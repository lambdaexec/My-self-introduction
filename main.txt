Hello, I am LambdaTechnology, a GDI Malware maker.
I'm interested in GDI.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with @coder-linjian @pankoza2-pl(Two big GDI malware maker)
(In fact, I'm 12 years old, but I'm good at C++ and I have a lot of knowledge of making GDI malwares)
How to find me:https://space.bilibili.com/3546842902038662 or lambdaexe114@foxmail.com(I have NO youtube accounts cuz I'm in Shanghai, China :/)
(I am a Chinese.So if some sentences I write has some grammer error,please pardon me :/)
The most important one:
N17Pro3426 was not get in to use my code, payloads,or bytebeats.
@N17Pro3426, how many GDI malwares did you copied?You copied from myself, xuge, even pankoza2-pl.You have violated our right to privacy. If this continues, you may be suspected of committing a crime.
